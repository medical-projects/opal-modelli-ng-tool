## BW Feedback 05.03.2018

### General
1. 'I'm not sure what I'm meant to do with it'
1. The starting point of a simple concept 'single tooth' can actually annoy some clinicians - as it could be seen as trivialising the complex social interaction that is occurring.
2. mindmaps I understand

### UI
1. not sure what 'schema' means
1. not sure what 'property' means
1. data type text very small
1. white on yellow not good visually
1. I have no idea what boolean or string means
1. human name - understood implicitly
1. not sure what 'widget' means

### Workflow
1. transition to GitHub was not immediately apparent to user

### Ideas/actions
1. we might need a preceding page to explain what it's for
2. might need to preface the UI with an explanation that we have deliberately taken a quite reductionist approach because of General/2
3. 'Schema Feedback' button label needs to change to something more understandable
4. Need to clearly signpost that this is not about a 'green-field' data modelling exercise (eg designing a new archetype from scratch), rather it is more about getting wider clinician feedback on an existing data design
