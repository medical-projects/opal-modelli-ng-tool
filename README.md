# Clinical models for Humans

This repo contains some proof-of-concept work into an alternative workflow for clinical data modelling by end-user clinicians.

Some of the issues we've tried to address are:

* The user interface should be understandable and usable by a clinician who is taking part in a clinical data modelling exercise
* Where possible, all parts of the workflow should use existing collaboration toolsets such as GitHub, and as such we've created the app as a simple wrapper over a GitHub repository
* Technical jargon words such as 'string' (used as a data type) should be replaced in the UI by more generally human-understood words like 'text'
* Actions available to the clinical data model reviewer should be named according to the clinicians' understanding of what is happening, as opposed to a GitHub workflow - eg 'feedback' rather than 'Create Issue' etc

The app is a very lightweight Angular.js application running entirely in the browser.
